      <h2>Important WingstopFreeFries Announcement</h2>

      <p>
        First though, some WingstopFreeFries history and the motivation behind
        this announcement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        It has been just under two years since the idea of WingstopFreeFries was
        conceived by me. It all started with me standing in line at Wingstop (a
        frequent event), realizing I could get free fries by filling out a
        survey, but also realizing how painfully slow and repetitive the process
        was. I started to learn all of the technologies required in order to
        create this website. And what came out was a quick little website to
        make getting free food easier. The very first users may remember how WFF
        looked and operated at first. Just a simple input form with a submit
        button, but it was slow and definitely not something you'd want to use
        while standing in line.
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, WingstopFreeFries grew beyond anything I expected. After a
        lot of tweaking and late-night bug fixing, I managed to cut the wait
        time from several minutes down to just a second. Eventually, the site
        expanded to support Panda Express, Rubios, and Blaze Pizza. Over time,
        it became a go-to tool for anyone looking to score some extra food
        without spending extra cash. With Final stats of 1,809 total uses and
        $9,341.86 saved. What started as a simple personal project turned into
        something that genuinely helped others.

        <b style="color: #ff5555"
          >Effective April 1st, 2025, I will be discontinuing the
          WingstopFreeFries website and service.</b
        >
        Until then, the site will be in an evacuation phase. Hereâ€™s what that
        means for users:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coupon generation will remain online until April 1st.</li>
        <li>No new fast food chains will be added.</li>
        <li>
          The feedback form will remain active for those who wish to leave a
          final note or memory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />
      Here is what will happen on and after the shutdown date:
      <ul>
        <li>The WingstopFreeFries site will go offline permanently.</li>
        <li>
          The domain
        <b>wingstopfreefries.xyz</b>  will
          no longer be maintained.
        </li>
        <li>The database containing stored coupons will be wiped.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <p>
        To everyone who used the site, shared it with friends, or even just got
        a free side of fries thanks to it. thank you. You made the project
        worthwhile. Itâ€™s been one of my favorite projects, not because it was
        the most advanced, but because it made a real impact.
      </p>
